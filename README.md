# StockMarketPrediction
This repository is an implementation part of stock market prediction project.

In order for it to work correctly you have to download, setup and run any model
from https://github.com/jfajkowski/stock-market-forecasting.
Now it is configured to ask all three models from research part.
If you want to configure it differently you have to change `*.properties` files.
